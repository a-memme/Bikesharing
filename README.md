# Bikesharing
## Analysis Overview 
Using tableau to visualize NYC Citibike useage data for the month of August 2019. The data was briefly cleaned using Python, exported into a csv file, and then visualized in tableau with the creation of a number of graphs.

## Results
The following visualizations were used to create a story in tableau, and reflect a number of relationships in the data:

Here, overall citibike useage for the month of August is displayed. As mentioned in the text box above, overall useage tends to be most popular within two predominate time frames: 7am-9am and 4pm-7pm.

Using a heatmap to reflect useage through each day of the week, the same time frames mentioned in the previous image are represented as being most popular when considering weekdays. When considering weekends however, there is a more gradual increase of bike useage through a longer time frame (i.e 10am-7pm as mentioned above). It's also interesting to note that the largest useage of bikes is occuring within the 5/6pm timeframe, as represented in the previous image. This is detectable by the darker red rectangles displayed on the heatmap.
